![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/art-sets-3.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="right" }Due to the current health situation weâ€˜ve decided to offer a new format to deliver our art sessions: "Art Activity Sets". These sets will include all you need to provide your children with a fully thought through art session. Each set covers a specific topic for the children to learn about. Depending on the topic these might include a book to introduce the topic fact cards, sample art pieces, and all art and craft materials needed.

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/art-sets-2.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="left" }Parents will be provided with a full lesson plan, which includes helpful tips and the explanation of learning areas and outcomes for your children.

To keep these art lesson sets affordable for you and to reduce on wast and packaging for the environment, the sets are given out on a rental base. Children keep their artwork, everything else goes back to us, quarantined for 3 days and afterwards thoroughly disinfected.

Delivery and pickup available.
