However the “Little Art Explorers” classes will be adapted to the needs of our younger artist. We will focus on sensory experiences and ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/little-art-explorers-3.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="left" }process art while the children get the opportunity to let their creativity run wild. At this age group it is most important to support children’s creativity, as this will set the stage to foster its continued development in the years beyond.

Activities are designed for children 3-5 years of age.
