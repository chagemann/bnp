![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/open-art-sessions-3.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="right" }In our open 1 hour art session, children are invited to complete an art and craft activity of their own choice. The children will be given a choice from a range of activity stations, where they will be free to choose in which activity they engage in. I will provide support to children if help is needed. ![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/open-art-sessions-2.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="left" }Parents are welcome to stay and participate with their children and just as welcome to relax and allow their little ones to create.

Activities are designed for children 5-8 years of age.
