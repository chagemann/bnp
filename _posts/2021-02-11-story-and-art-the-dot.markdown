![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/story-and-art-the-dot.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="right" }During this session we will be looking at one of my favourite art books for children, "The Dot" by Peter H. Reynolds. In this book the author focuses on perfectionism and insecurity and shows in a kind and humorous way that getting work started can be the hardest part in a creative endeavour. 

In relation to the book each child will then be creating a dot themed art work and exploring a variety of media and art techniques. Finally, we will be finishing off the art session with an activity in which the children work together to create a large circle painting and where all children get to make their mark.

Activities are designed for children 6-10 years of age.
