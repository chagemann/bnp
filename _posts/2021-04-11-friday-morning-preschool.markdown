Together we will paint, experiment, do handicrafts, read, play and much more. While all activities take into account the holistic development of the children it is my main concern to give children space and inspiration for creativity to bid. Bubbles & Paint is a place where children have the opportunity to express their ideas and let their imagination run wild.

This class is suitable for children between 3 and 5 years of age. You are welcome to [contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if youâ€™d like any further information.
