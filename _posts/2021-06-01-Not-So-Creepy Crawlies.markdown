![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/creepy-crawlies-2.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="right" }One of our favourite sessions is back. This "Not so creepy crawlies" class is specifically adapted to the needs of our youngest artists. Exploring and learning about bugs as well as creating art and craft – all included in one fun session.

Using a combination of recycled and new materials each child is invited to put together their very own "Not-so-creepy crawly".

As always in our sessions creativity is first priority and accordingly this activity is open to each child’s interpretation. Using oil pastels, acrylic paint and water colour the children also get the opportunity to experiment with a variety of art media.
