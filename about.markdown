![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/anne2.jpg){: .postImage width="200" align="left" }My name is Anne and I'm the owner of Bubbles and Paint. 

I hold a Master degree of Inclusive Learning Therapy from the University of Hamburg and a diploma in Occupational Therapy (from Germany). I have also got an Australian qualification as Early Childhood Educator.

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/anne-aboutme.jpg){: .postImage width="400" align="right" }At Bubbles and Paint we encourage children to be creative through the
use of carefully planned holistic learning experiences. We aim to make
both children and their families feel valued and welcomed. Bubbles and
Paint is a place where the thrill of discovery is promoted in a safe,
positive and engaging way. It is also important to us that children of
all abilities are openly embraced.

We offer classes that focus in different areas such as:

- Sensory art for children from 18 months
- Art and science for children (4 – 8 years)
- Little Art Explorers (3 – 5 years)
- Focus on fine-motor development
- Parent and children classes
- Art and story
