use of carefully planned holistic learning experiences. We aim to make
both children and their families feel valued and welcomed. Bubbles and
Paint is a place where the thrill of discovery is promoted in a safe,
positive and engaging way. It is also important to us that children of
all abilities are openly embraced.

We offer classes that focus in different areas such as:

- Sensory art for children from 18 months
- Art and science for children (4 – 8 years)
- Little Art Explorers (3 – 5 years)
- Focus on fine-motor development
- Parent and children classes
- Art and story
